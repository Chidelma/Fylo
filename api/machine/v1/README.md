# FYLO Machine Protocol v1

FYLO's machine interface is a local, bounded NDJSON protocol. One UTF-8 JSON
request and one UTF-8 JSON response occupy one LF-delimited frame.

The canonical artifacts are:

- [`schema.json`](schema.json): request and response envelope;
- [`operations.json`](operations.json): operation names, mutability, and retry
  classification;
- [`fixtures.ndjson`](fixtures.ndjson): transport-level conformance examples;
- [`../../errors/v1.json`](../../errors/v1.json): stable public error codes.

## Framing

- Protocol version: `1`
- Encoding: UTF-8
- Delimiter: LF (`0x0a`)
- Delimiter counts toward limit: no
- Default maximum request: 1 MiB
- Default maximum response: 8 MiB
- Maximum configured frame: 64 MiB
- Duplicate JSON keys: rejected
- Truncated final frame: error and terminate
- Malformed complete frame: error and resume at the next LF

Requests do not include `protocolVersion`; compatibility is established through
`handshake`. Every response includes `protocolVersion`.

## Errors

Error responses have a stable `error.code`. The human-readable
`error.message` is diagnostic and must not be parsed. Clients may retry only
when the operation registry says retry is safe and the concrete error is
documented as transient.

## Compatibility

Within protocol v1:

- operation names and stable error codes are preserved;
- additive result fields are allowed;
- clients must ignore unknown result fields;
- request fields remain operation-specific;
- changing idempotency, durability, or retry behavior requires a new protocol
  version or an explicit compatibility RFC.
